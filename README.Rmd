# SynergyLMM

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A comprehensive statistical framework for designing and analyzing _in vivo_ drug combination experiments. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of SynergyLMM from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("RafRomB/SynergyLMM")
```

## Example Use of SynergyLMM

This is a basic example which shows how to use SynergyLMM to analyze synergy in a 2-drug combination _in vivo_ experiment.

```{r load_SynergyLMM}
library(SynergyLMM)
```

We start by loading the data (in long format). We will use the example data provided in the package:

```{r load_data}
data("grwth_data")
```

### 1. Fit Model

The first step is fitting the model from our data:

```{r fit_model, echo=FALSE}
# Most simple model
lmmModel(
 data = grwth_data,
 sample_id = "subject",
 time = "Time",
 treatment = "Treatment",
 tumor_vol = "TumorVolume",
 trt_control = "Control",
 drug_a = "DrugA",
 drug_b = "DrugB",
 combination = "Combination"
 )
```


What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
