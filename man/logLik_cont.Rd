\title{Contributions of the individual subjects to the log-likelihood for the model.}
\usage{
logLik_cont(model, lLik_thrh, label_angle = 0, varName = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class "lme" representing the linear mixed-effects model fitted by \code{\link[=LMM_Model]{LMM_Model()}}.}

\item{lLik_thrh}{Threshold of log-likelihood contribution.}

\item{label_angle}{Angle for the label of subjects with a log-likelihood contribution smaller than \code{lLik_thrh}.}

\item{varName}{Name of the variable for the weights of the model in the case that a variance structure has been specified using \code{\link[nlme:varIdent]{nlme::varIdent()}}.}
}
\value{
Returns a plot of the per-observation individual-subject log-likelihood contibutions to the model, indicating those subjects
whose contribution is smaller than \code{lLik_thrh}.
}
\description{
Contributions of the individual subjects to the log-likelihood for the model.
