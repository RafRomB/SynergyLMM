\title{Visualization of residuals diagnostics for a fitted linear mixed model of tumor growth data.}
\usage{
Plot_resid_diag(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class "lme" representing the linear mixed-effects model fitted by \code{\link[=lmm_model]{lmm_model()}}.}
}
\value{
A list with different plots for evaluating the normality and homoscedasticity of the random effects, including:
\itemize{
\item A normal Q-Q plot of the normalized residuals of the model.
\item A normal Q-Q plot of the normalized residuals of the model by Day.
\item A normal Q-Q plot of the normalized residuals of the model by Treatment.
\item A dotplot of pearson residuals vs fitted values.
\item A dotplot of the pearson residuals by Day and Treatment.
